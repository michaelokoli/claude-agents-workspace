  # Purpose

     - Key topics and timestamps
     - Channel information
  3. Analyze content for:
     - Main concepts and ideas
     - Step-by-step instructions (if tutorial)
     - Key takeaways and insights
     - Important quotes or definitions
     - Resources mentioned
  4. Organize learning content into structured format
  5. Identify actionable items or practice exercises

  - Highlight technical terms with brief explanations
  - If transcript unavailable, work with description and comments
