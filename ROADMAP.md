# Claude Agents Workspace - Project Roadmap

This roadmap tracks planned features, enhancements, and future development priorities for the hierarchical multi-agent system.

---

## 🔥 Immediate Priorities (Next 1-2 Weeks)

### Critical Bug Fixes
- [x] **Integrate existing YouTube transcript fetcher into podcast processor** ✅ COMPLETED
  - **Status**: Fixed as requested - YouTube URLs now use transcript API directly
  - **Issue**: Was requiring ffmpeg for YouTube URLs
  - **Solution**: Implemented detection and routing to `get_transcript.py`
  - **Impact**: No ffmpeg needed, 10-100x faster, uses existing captions
  - **File**: `scripts/podcast_processor.py`
  - **Documentation**: Updated `docs/podcast-setup.md` with new YouTube section

### Testing & Validation
- [ ] Test full knowledge base workflow end-to-end
  - Run complete pipeline: fetch → analyze → extract claims → build KB entry
  - Verify relationship detection works
  - Test search utility with real entries
- [ ] Create second knowledge entry to test relationship detection
  - Use existing transcript at `learning/raw-transcripts/7B2HJr0Y68g.txt`
  - Simulate confirming/contradicting claims
- [ ] Validate speaker profile creation and updates

### Agent Improvements (From Anthropic Official Guidance)
- [x] **Add logging to project-coordinator for tracking sub-agent delegations** ✅ COMPLETED
  - **Priority**: HIGH - Critical for observability of autonomous actions
  - Log all tool calls and results to stderr
  - Track task progress with clear status updates
  - Maintain audit trail for agent activities
  - **File**: `agents/project-coordinator.yml`
  - **Implemented**: Added comprehensive logging section to coordinator
  - **Documentation**: `docs/coordinator-logging-guide.md`
  - **Test Script**: `test_coordinator_logging.py`

- [x] **Document 2-3 business value metrics for agent workspace** ✅ COMPLETED
  - **Priority**: HIGH - Align with Anthropic's business-value-first approach
  - **Documented Metrics** (with transparency on data sources):
    - Research Synthesis: 88 seconds measured performance (manual baseline needed)
    - Knowledge Discovery: 100% relationship checking (vs estimated 10-20% manual)
    - MCP Development: 400+ lines of knowledge added (time savings estimated)
  - **Status**: Framework created, awaiting user baseline measurements for true ROI
  - **File**: Created `docs/business-value-metrics.md`

- [ ] **Test web_search tool with content-analyzer on next analysis task**
  - **Priority**: MEDIUM - Leverage platform tools instead of building from scratch
  - Add web_search to content-analyzer tools list
  - Test on real-world research task
  - Compare results with/without web search
  - **File**: `agents/content-analyzer.yml`

## 💡 Ideas & Research Needed

Features that need more investigation before implementation:

- **Real-time collaboration**: How would multiple users interact with the knowledge base simultaneously?
- **Privacy & security**: How to handle sensitive content in knowledge base?
- **Scalability**: What happens when knowledge base reaches 10,000+ entries?
- **Export formats**: What formats would be most useful (PDF, EPUB, Notion, Obsidian)?
- **Agent autonomy levels**: Should agents be able to make decisions without coordinator approval?
